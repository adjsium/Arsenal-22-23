<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project aims to utilise Python, Jupyther Notebook and Plotly library to visualise 2022-2023 PL Arsenal seasonal data and gain insight regarding how Arsenal performed this season.
- Question 1: How many matches Arsenal won with higher xG score?
- Question 2: When Arsenal start struggling on title race?
- Question 3: How effecient is Arsenal in this season?


### Background and Motivation
As a Arsenal fan and data-savvy person, I am curious the story behind Arsenal's seasonal data and <b> reveal why they struggling at the end of the season</b>, losing #1 position in Premier League thus season.

<h4>League Structure</h4>
The Premier League, consisting of <b> 20 teams</b> , follows a round-robin format. Each team plays <b> 38 matches in a season</b> , facing every other team twice. A win  earns<b> 3 points</b> , a draw results in<b> 1 point</b>, and a loss gives <b>no points</b>. The team with the most points at the end of the season is crowned <b>the champion</b>.

### What is xG?
Expected goal (xG)  is a way to measure the quality of a team or player's chances of<b> scoring a goal</b>. It takes into account factors like the <b>location of the shot</b>, <b>the type of shot</b>, and the <b> number of defenders </b>in the way. The higher the xG, the <b><i>more likely </i></b>a team to score.

### Glossary and Terms
- GF:Goals For (sometimes used in place of GS).
- GA:Goals Against (i.e., number of goals conceded by a team).
- ST:Shots Taken
- SA:Shots Against
- SOT:Shot on Target

xG/xGa Statistics by match week:

Expected Goals (xG) that's used to measure how good scoring chances were in football games. Crazy thing is, sometimes <b>the team with a higher xG loses</b>, and <b>the team with a lower xG wins</b>. Crazy right? This can happen because the team with more xG might choke and not score, while the other team is more efficient and scores with less chances. So basically, having a high xG doesn't guarantee winning in football games.
